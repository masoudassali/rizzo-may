    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how [Your App Name] (the "App," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information from and about you when you use our services. By using our App, you agree to the collection and use of your information in accordance with this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect for various purposes, including to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide and maintain the App's functionality.</li>
        <li>Improve, personalize, and expand our services.</li>

    <h2>3. Use of Generative AI</h2>
    <p>Our App utilizes generative AI models to provide certain features. This section describes how your data may be handled in this context:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Processing of Content:</strong> When you use features that rely on generative AI (e.g., creating text, images, or code), the content you provide is sent to our AI model. This processing is essential for the feature to function as intended.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-Party AI Providers:</strong> We may use third-party AI service providers (such as OpenAI, Google, etc.) to power our generative AI features. This means the content you input may be shared with these third-party providers for processing. These providers have their own privacy policies governing their use of your data.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Usage for Model Training:</strong> By default, content submitted to generative AI models may be used to improve and train those models. We will take reasonable steps to prevent the use of your personally identifiable information for this purpose where feasible and as required by law.</li>
        <li><strong>Anonymization:</strong> To the extent possible, we may anonymize or de-identify the data processed by our AI models to protect your privacy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We will not share or sell your personal information to third parties without your consent, except in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We may share your information with trusted third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf (e.g., hosting, data analysis, marketing).</li>
        <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to a valid request from a governmental or judicial authority.</li>
        <li><strong>In Case of Business Transfer:</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, and disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>
