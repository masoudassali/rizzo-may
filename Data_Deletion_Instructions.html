    <h1>Basic Data Deletion Instructions</h1>
    
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Identify the Data:</strong> Clearly identify the specific data (files, records, backups, etc.) you intend to delete, ensuring it's no longer needed and any legal or regulatory retention periods have expired.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Back Up Necessary Data:</strong> Before deletion, create a secure and verified backup of any data that might be required in the future for compliance, audits, or business continuity.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Use Secure Deletion Methods:</strong> Employ secure and irrecoverable deletion methods like data sanitization, overwriting, or degaussing, especially for sensitive data on storage media that will be reused or disposed of.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Verify Deletion:</strong> Confirm that the data has been successfully and permanently removed from all primary storage locations, including local drives, cloud services, and any off-site or archival backups.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Document the Process:</strong> Maintain a record of the deletion process, including what data was deleted, when, by whom, and the method used, for audit and compliance purposes.</li>
    </ol>
